# Supervised Learning for COE Prices

### Context:

Just this year, Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums for Categories A, B and E rose to an ‘all-time high’, seeing approximately a 3% increase for Category A during the most recent bidding on 22 March 2023. Those who wish to own a vehicle in Singapore must bid for and successfully obtain a COE for each vehicle. The sharp spike in COE premiums not only affects households which purchase vehicles for personal use, but even more so car rental companies which acquire vehicles on a large scale.

This project aims to predict Category A COE prices in the next few years, using historical data from 2002 to 2023 ("COE.csv").

### Methodology:
- Conduct Data Preprocessing;
- Supervised Machine-Learning techniques: Regularised Regression (ElasticNet), Time-Series Decomposition and K-Nearest Neighbors Classification;
- Train the models and test for optimal hyperparameters via Cross-Validation;
- Choose model with most accurate predictions.
