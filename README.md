# Supervised Learning for COE Prices

### Context:

Just this year, Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums for Categories A, B and E rose to an ‘all-time high’, seeing approximately a 3% increase for Category A during the most recent bidding on 22 March 2023. Those who wish to own a vehicle in Singapore must bid for and successfully obtain a COE for each vehicle. The sharp spike in COE premiums not only affects households which purchase vehicles for personal use, but even more so car rental companies which acquire vehicles on a large scale.

This project aims to implement a machine-learning model to learn and predict Category A COE prices using historical data from 2002 to 2023 ("COE.csv"). The data contains features such as date, bid prices and quotas per bidding round across all category tiers. 

### Methodology:
- Data Preprocessing;
- Supervised Learning techniques: Regularised Regression (ElasticNet), Time-Series Decomposition and K-Nearest Neighbors Classification;
- Model Training and Hyperparameter Testing;
- Evaluation of Models.
